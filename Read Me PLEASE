# Automatic-Attendence-Management-System-using-Face_Recognition-PROJECT

An automatic attendance system using face recognition is a system that uses a face detection algorithm to detect and recognize students in a classroom and mark their attendance12.

The system uses machine learning techniques such as CNN algorithm2. 

The faculty has access to add the student details such as name, USN, phone number, email-id.

An efficient algorithm of haar cascade using an open-source image processing framework known as OpenCV is used in the system1.

The most Important benifit is ....Its replacing paper-based timesheets with appropriate attendance management software will help organizations save time, reduce administrative work, maintain accurate attendance records, and eliminate process bottlenecks3.
